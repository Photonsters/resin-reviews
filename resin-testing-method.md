## GENERAL TESTS

- Cost per kg
- Availability (distribuitors)
- Density uncured (Advertised / Mesured - weigh/volume)
- Density cured (Advertised / Mesured - weigh/volume)
- Viscosity (Advertised / Mesured - Need a density cup or 45Âºtestrig ramp?/[printed cup?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5KQFpNGrQA))
- Color pre-cure (subjective + controlled light photo of a break sample? [Arduino Color sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDAOGcI9cv4))
- Color post-cure (subjective + controlled light photo of a break sample? Arduino color sensor?)
- Smell (subjective test - Check if the VOC sensosrs can detect a smelly resin from a non smelly one)

- Exposure sweet spot
- Exposure range
- Dimensional Accuracy
- Detail holding at sweet spot (select or create a photonsters test like [ameratown](https://ameralabs.com/blog/town-calibration-part/) for confirmation)
- Minimum support size @50u layer (develop a test)
- Exotermic reaction on a cup
- Resin Sedimentation and setting over 24h period
- Washing solvent

## POST CURE TESTS

### BREAK TESTS (needs the OpenSource UTM machine)

- Exposure Card Bending results (does it break or does it flex)
- Manual Subjective break test
- Manual Mesured KG @ break
- Kg at tensile break (Tensile strenght)
- Kg at 3 point break (Break force)
- Kg at compression failure


### OTHER TESTS

- Burn test (does it ignite, if so does it leave ash)
- Suitable for casting? (define test method)
- Heat resistance (how much heat does it take before failing integrity)
- Shrinking
- Thin part warping
- VOCs (how? [Arduino VOC sensor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdFb6-4bsHk) which?)
