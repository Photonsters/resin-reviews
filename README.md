# resin-reviews
Project to define test collect and compile UV resin tests and results for the Photon

----

## TIER 0 - Basic Resin Calibration

- Log resin initial temperature
- [Run resin exposure finder](https://github.com/altLab/photon-resin-calibration)
- Print the validation test model with the resin sweet spot
- Print optional steps*
- Clean the print and take photos
- Log the go-nogo result
- Submit the results and photos using [this form] 

```
*Optional Steps
These steps will allow you to confirm how your resin does when 
overcured/undercured and help you establish a working range.

- Re-print the validation model with overcuring
- Re-print the validation model with undercuring
- Log the go-nogo results and compare results
```


## TIER 0 - Basic Resin Properties

- Bend XP card and log the result
- Machinability - Drill and Tap ability

```
*Optional Steps
- Log Color before curing (subjective naming or photo)
- Log Color after curing (subjective naming or photo)
- Log Color after a week (subjective naming or photo)
```
